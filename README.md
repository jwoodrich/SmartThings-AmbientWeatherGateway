# SmartThings-AmbientWeatherGateway
AmbientWeather.net gateway for SmartThings

Pulls in data from AmbientWeather.net, displaying temperature, relative humidity, wind speed/direction and gusts, rain stats, and UV index.

Requires an API key and an application key from https://www.ambientweather.com/api.html.  Upon configuring keys, the SmartApp should create devices in SmartThings for each device accessible to those keys.

Polling frequency is configurable.

Use at your own risk.  It works for me.
